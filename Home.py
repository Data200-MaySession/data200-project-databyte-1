### ðŸ¤– About the Model

We use a **Ridge Regression** model (a regularized linear regression) for robust, interpretable cost prediction:

- Handles many features (including one-hot encoded cities/levels) without overfitting.
- Provides fast, reliable estimates for a wide range of programs and locations.

Example structure:

```python
Pipeline(steps=[
    ("scaler", StandardScaler()),
    ("regressor", Ridge(alpha=1.0))
])
```
